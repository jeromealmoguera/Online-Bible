<br />

<p class="paragraph">1 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. <br /><br />

    2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. <br /><br />
    
    3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. <br /><br />
    
    4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. <br /><br />
    
    5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: <br /><br />
    
    6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. <br /><br />
    
    7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. <br /><br />
    
    8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. <br /><br />
    
    9 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. <br /><br />
    
    10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. <br /><br />
    
    11 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. <br /><br />
    
    12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, <br /><br />
    
    13 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: <br /><br />
    
    14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us. <br /><br />
    
    15 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. <br /><br />
