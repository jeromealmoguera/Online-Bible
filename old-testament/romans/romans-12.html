<br />

<p class="paragraph">1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. <br /><br />

  2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. <br /><br />
  
  3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. <br /><br />
  
  4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: <br /><br />
  
  5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. <br /><br />
  
  6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; <br /><br />
  
  7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; <br /><br />
  
  8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. <br /><br />
  
  9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. <br /><br />
  
  10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; <br /><br />
  
  11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; <br /><br />
  
  12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; <br /><br />
  
  13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. <br /><br />
  
  14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. <br /><br />
  
  15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. <br /><br />
  
  16 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. <br /><br />
  
  17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. <br /><br />
  
  18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. <br /><br />
  
  19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. <br /><br />
  
  20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. <br /><br />
  
  21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. <br /><br />
