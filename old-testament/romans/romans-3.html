<p class="paragraph">1 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision? <br /><br />

  2 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God. <br /><br />
  
  3 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? <br /><br />
  
  4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. <br /><br />
  
  5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) <br /><br />
  
  6 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? <br /><br />
  
  7 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? <br /><br />
  
  8 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just. <br /><br />
  
  9 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; <br /><br />
  
  10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: <br /><br />
  
  11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. <br /><br />
  
  12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. <br /><br />
  
  13 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: <br /><br />
  
  14 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: <br /><br />
  
  15 Their feet are swift to shed blood: <br /><br />
  
  16 Destruction and misery are in their ways: <br /><br />
  
  17 And the way of peace have they not known: <br /><br />
  
  18 There is no fear of God before their eyes. <br /><br />
  
  19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. <br /><br />
  
  20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. <br /><br />
  
  21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; <br /><br />
  
  22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: <br /><br />
  
  23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; <br /><br />
  
  24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: <br /><br />
  
  25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; <br /><br />
  
  26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. <br /><br />
  
  27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. <br /><br />
  
  28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. <br /><br />
  
  29 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: <br /><br />
  
  30 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. <br /><br />
  
  31 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. <br /><br />
