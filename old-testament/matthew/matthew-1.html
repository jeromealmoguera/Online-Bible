<p class="paragraph">1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. <br /><br />

    2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;<br /><br />
    
    3 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;<br /><br />
    
    4 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;<br /><br />
    
    5 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;<br /><br />
    
    6 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;<br /><br />
    
    7 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;<br /><br />
    
    8 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;<br /><br />
    
    9 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;<br /><br />
    
    10 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;<br /><br />
    
    11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:<br /><br />
    
    12 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;<br /><br />
    
    13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;<br /><br />
    
    14 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;<br /><br />
    
    15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;<br /><br />
    
    16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.<br /><br />
    
    17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.<br /><br />
    
    18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.<br /><br />
    
    19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.<br /><br />
    
    20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.<br /><br />
    
    21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins.<br /><br />
    
    22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,<br /><br />
    
    23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.<br /><br />
    
    24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:<br /><br />
    
    25 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus.</p>
